## Introduction

The data used in study is taken from <http://open.canada.ca/en/open-data>.

```{r, echo = F}
glacier <- read.csv("glacier.csv", comment.char = "#", na.strings = "..")
```

The data set contains `r nrow(glacier)` measurements of `r nlevels(glacier$GEO)` 
Canadian glacier mass balans, collected from `r min(glacier$Ref_Date)` till 
`r max(glacier$Ref_Date)`. Namely, the file includes these glaciers:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
levels(glacier$GEO)
```

Just beautiful formula:
